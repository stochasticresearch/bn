function [] = learnstruct_hc_llproxy(dagModelObj, seeddag)
%LEARNSTRUCT_HC learn the structure of the HCBN network using
%               the hill climbing algorithm as described in 
%               Koller and Friedman (2009).  The code for this 
%               is based off the structure learning toolbox 
%               within BNT.  See BNT/SLP/learn_struct_hc.m.
%               This will use the X dataset that was passed to 
%               the constructor to learn the structure.
%
% Inputs:
%  dagModelObj - should be either a HCBN, CLG, or MTE object.
%                See copula/hcbn/hcbn.m, copula/clg/clg.m, copula/mte/mte.m
%  seeddag - a DAG which can be used as a reference DAG as a
%            starting point for the search process.  This is
%            optional, and can be an empty array if no seed is
%            desired.
